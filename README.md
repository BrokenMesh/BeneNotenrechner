<!-- BUILD -->
## Build Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   To get started, clone the repository using the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BrokenMesh/BeneNotenrechner.git
   ```
   
2. **Install the Latest MySQL Version**
   
   You can download and install the latest version of MySQL from [this link](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer).
  
3. **Import the Database**

   Import the database by using the 'BeneNotenRechner.sql' file found in the root directory.
   
4. **Build the Project with Visual Studio**

   Building the project with Visual Studio can be done in various ways. You can either build or publish both the 'BeneNotenrechner' and 'Dev_API' projects.

5. **Configuration**

   Upon startup, the application will search for a 'Config.txt' file in the working directory. If it doesn't find one, it will use the default settings:
   - Host: "localhost"
   - User: "root"
   - Password: ""
   - Database: "benenotenrechner_db"
   - Mail Server: "http://localhost:5008/api/TokenMail"
   - Required Host: ""
   
   If you need different configurations, you should copy the 'Config.txt' file from the 'BeneNotenrechner' project to the working directory of the final executable and make the necessary changes.

6. **Mail Server Configuration**
   The BeneNotentool utilizes a separate executable, known as Dev_API (the name may change), to handle emails. Configuration for this is also managed through a 'Config.txt' file located in the project's working directory.
